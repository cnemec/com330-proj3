        <h1>RPG MAKER HORROR GAMES</h1>
        <h2>brief disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
      The horror game is definitely one of the hardest genres to get right,
      especially if the characters are small and the camera is zoomed out where
      everything is in frame. As such most of these games are not good, if anything
      most of them would make the player cringe before they induce fright.
        </p>
        <h2>Yume nikki inspiration</h2>
        <p>
      Some could argue that horror games in rpg maker are just inspired by yume nikki.
      While this is true the nightmares of yume nikki inspired creators to try to
      make these games scary I would say they aren't the same genre. While they
      came from the same roots they expanded into their own genres.
        </p>
        <h2>IB</h2>
        <p>
      IB is the story of a little girl, named IB, trapped in an art gallery, one that is slowly
      becoming hell pulling her in to teach her a lesson. Similar to silent hill
      in a way except obviously the little girl did nothing truly wrong to deserve
      being punished. Though now there the player has to run from monsters, solve
      puzzles and talk with other survivors to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
      The story of IB is all about growing up, and how that causes people to see
      the world completely differently as they grow up. This can be seen in a few
      subtle ways only a game could show. Such as at the start of the game there are
      words that IB doesn't know but by the end if you read the text again she will
      understand the words. As well as seeing the game from the perspective of an
      adult and a child, things that would be cute and innocent for one of them will
      be dark and distorted for another, this has a real life parallel in porcelain dolls.
      There are many more examples of this but I will leave that to people curious
      in the games to discover themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Ib fanart</h3>
        <p>
      IB's unique aesthetic has inspired a lot of fans to make art of their own.
      Now unlike yume nikki where that art is other games due to the game having
      more character focused narratives most of it is art of the characters.
      Below is a small collection of popular fan art I found online.
