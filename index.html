      <h1>YUME NIKKI</h1>
      <h2>yume nikki itself</h2>
      <p>
        Yume nikki is a game developed by the japanese developer kikiyama using rpg
        maker. It was solely about exploring the dreams of the main character collecting
        effects on the way. The game plays by simply walking around exploring dreams
        connected through various points, occasionally using effects to pass, with a
        bird's eyes view.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the concept seems simple it was revolutionary in the era completely
        innovating independent games forming what was basically its own genre.
        People were amazed by the pure creativity and expansiveness of this game,
        which came completely out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game wasn't exploring just anyone's dreams though. Due to the consistent
        themes and layout of these dreams fans were able to expand on the story.
        Finding the simple looking game was hiding some pretty dark themes.

      <h3>The dawn of fan games</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the amazing reception of yume nikki others were bound to be inspired.
        Yume nikki basically became it's own genre creating games like .flow.
        Taking the environmental and mental story telling of yume nikki and making
        its own story.
      </p>
      <p>
        .flow has much darker dreams having the main character trapped in a hospital
        room instead of their home like in yume nikki. The setting is much more melancholy
        being a story about a girl dying of disease just trying to remember her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        While .flow will always have a place in the community the biggest fan game
        is yume 2kki a collaborated effort of the entire fan community. This game
        while having less stories lets the player experience the dreams of the entire
        fanbase. Where people will have completely different experiences playing.
        And with the rise of walking simulators and exploration games the foresight
        of these games is rather impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        What this game lacks in themes it more than makes up for it in being an
        experience. You can really feel the passion in the whole community, their love
        for the series all coming together to make a game that could be a worthy sequel.
        That kind of love for a project always manages to come through to the player.
