      <h1>YUME NIKKI</h1>
      <h2>yume nikki itself</h2>
      <p>
        Yume nikki is a game developed by the japanese developer kikiyama using rpg
        maker. It was solely about exploring the dreams of the main character collecting
        effects on the way. The game plays by simply walking around exploring dreams
        connected through various points, occasionally using effects to pass, with a
        bird's eyes view.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the concept seems simple it was revolutionary in the era completely
        innovating independent games forming what was basically its own genre.
        People were amazed by the pure creativity and expansiveness of this game,
        which came completely out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game wasn't exploring just anyone's dreams though. Due to the consistent
        themes and layout of these dreams fans were able to expand on the story.
        Finding the simple looking game was hiding some pretty dark themes.

      <h3>The dawn of fan games</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the amazing reception of yume nikki others were bound to be inspired.
        Yume nikki basically became it's own genre creating games like .flow.
        Taking the environmental and mental story telling of yume nikki and making
        its own story.
      </p>
      <p>
        .flow has much darker dreams having the main character trapped in a hospital
        room instead of their home like in yume nikki. The setting is much more melancholy
        being a story about a girl dying of disease just trying to remember her life.
      </p>
      <p>
        While .flow will always have a place in the community the biggest fan game
        is yume 2kki a collaborated effort of the entire fan community. This game
        while having less stories lets the player experience the dreams of the entire
        fanbase. Where people will have completely different experiences playing.
        And with the rise of walking simulators and exploration games the foresight
        of these games is rather impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        What this game lacks in themes it more than makes up for it in being an
        experience. You can really feel the passion in the whole community, their love
        for the series all coming together to make a game that could be a worthy sequel.
        That kind of love for a project always manages to come through to the player.

        <h1>META NARRATIVE GAMES</h1>
        <h2>OFF</h2>
        <p>
          OFF is a game created by martin Georis or Mortis Ghost as that is the pseudonym
          he used for the game, made in 2008. The story  is rather interesting using
          its medium to affect the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gameplay is that of a fairly standard jrpg with puzzles. Think of the
          battles as the original final fantasys and the puzzles as something out of
          professor layton. The camera is the same as yume nikki as the engine loses
          moddability in order to be more useable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meta element came from the name OFF. For one the game isn't downloaded
          as the game itself, you open a file creating the game. This plays to the theme
          of you being the one who caused the world to be created the way it is. As
          such it is your responsibility to fix it. By turning the world OFF
        </p>
        <h2>The expansion on meta games</h2>
        <h4>one shot</h4>
        <p>
          One shot is the story of a wandering creature in a doomed world living on your
          pc. The inhabitants see you as a god and are trying anything to save their home.
          A lot comes up but due to the fact they are still selling the game I will
          avoid spoilers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One shot is interesting due to the way it plays. The name and setting aren't
          just there to be weird if you close the game that's it, and the game makes
          files on your pc for puzzles. It takes advantage of what a game is and the setting
          to make a compelling narrative that complements the game.
        </p>
        <h4>Space funeral</h4>
        <p>
          Space funeral is extremely weird as if it is completely built around being
          strange. The characters are creatures like horses made out of legs or a
          boy that always cries, whose walking animation constantly changes proportions.
          The world and setting is odd, mean and oddly funny at points.
        </p>
        <p>
          This all makes sense considering the ideology of the creator of the game.
          The creator hated the new trend of making pixel art games as if it is the only
          type of independent game. He wanted to make something completely strange in
          order to cause innovation. It used its setting as a game to allow a typical
          cliche world to be morphed into a completely original one leading to a strange
          and needless to say interesting story.

        <h1>RPG MAKER HORROR GAMES</h1>
        <h2>brief disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The horror game is definitely one of the hardest genres to get right,
          especially if the characters are small and the camera is zoomed out where
          everything is in frame. As such most of these games are not good, if anything
          most of them would make the player cringe before they induce fright.
        </p>
        <h2>Yume nikki inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Some could argue that horror games in rpg maker are just inspired by yume nikki.
          While this is true the nightmares of yume nikki inspired creators to try to
          make these games scary I would say they aren't the same genre. While they
          came from the same roots they expanded into their own genres.
        </p>
        <h2>IB</h2>
        <p>
          IB is the story of a little girl, named IB, trapped in an art gallery, one that is slowly
          becoming hell pulling her in to teach her a lesson. Similar to silent hill
          in a way except obviously the little girl did nothing truly wrong to deserve
          being punished. Though now there the player has to run from monsters, solve
          puzzles and talk with other survivors to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of IB is all about growing up, and how that causes people to see
          the world completely differently as they grow up. This can be seen in a few
          subtle ways only a game could show. Such as at the start of the game there are
          words that IB doesn't know but by the end if you read the text again she will
          understand the words. As well as seeing the game from the perspective of an
          adult and a child, things that would be cute and innocent for one of them will
          be dark and distorted for another, this has a real life parallel in porcelain dolls.
          There are many more examples of this but I will leave that to people curious
          in the games to discover themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Ib fanart</h3>
        <p>
          IB's unique aesthetic has inspired a lot of fans to make art of their own.
          Now unlike yume nikki where that art is other games due to the game having
          more character focused narratives most of it is art of the characters.
          Below is a small collection of popular fan art I found online.
