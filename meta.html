        <h1>META NARRATIVE GAMES</h1>
        <h2>OFF</h2>
        <p>
      OFF is a game created by martin Georis or Mortis Ghost as that is the pseudonym
      he used for the game, made in 2008. The story  is rather interesting using
      its medium to affect the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
      The gameplay is that of a fairly standard jrpg with puzzles. Think of the
      battles as the original final fantasys and the puzzles as something out of
      professor layton. The camera is the same as yume nikki as the engine loses
      moddability in order to be more useable.
        </p>
        <p>
      The meta element came from the name OFF. For one the game isn't downloaded
      as the game itself, you open a file creating the game. This plays to the theme
      of you being the one who caused the world to be created the way it is. As
      such it is your responsibility to fix it. By turning the world OFF
        </p>
        <h2>The expansion on meta games</h2>
        <h4>one shot</h4>
        <p>
      One shot is the story of a wandering creature in a doomed world living on your
      pc. The inhabitants see you as a god and are trying anything to save their home.
      A lot comes up but due to the fact they are still selling the game I will
      avoid spoilers.
        </p>
        <p>
      One shot is interesting due to the way it plays. The name and setting aren't
      just there to be weird if you close the game that's it, and the game makes
      files on your pc for puzzles. It takes advantage of what a game is and the setting
      to make a compelling narrative that complements the game.
        </p>
        <h4>Space funeral</h4>
        <p>
      Space funeral is extremely weird as if it is completely built around being
      strange. The characters are creatures like horses made out of legs or a
      boy that always cries, whose walking animation constantly changes proportions.
      The world and setting is odd, mean and oddly funny at points.
        </p>
        <p>
      This all makes sense considering the ideology of the creator of the game.
      The creator hated the new trend of making pixel art games as if it is the only
      type of independent game. He wanted to make something completely strange in
      order to cause innovation. It used its setting as a game to allow a typical
      cliche world to be morphed into a completely original one leading to a strange
      and needless to say interesting story.
